-- q14: 64-possible-worlds-semantics with lambdas. 
-- we calculate the expression (100*x[1]/x[2]) in a list_transform-lambda for all 64 outcomes
-- the outcome of that expression is then reduced to a single noised value with pac_noised() and cast it to its expected type
-- since that expression contains two aggregates, we list_zip two counters into a list of two values first
-- the inner list-_transforms are just to cast the DOUBLE counter values back to their original type
-- the final computed expression is then reduced to a single noised double value using pac_noised and cast to the exptected type
